# iron
Iron Virtual Machine


To build you need to have the latest implementation of Go on your system.

Run the command

    go get github.com/jkbbwr/iron
    go build -a github.com/jkbbwr/iron
    
This will produce a binary `iron` in the current working directory.


The parser isn't on github yet. it should follow soon.
